Created using HTML, CSS and Javascript as part of The Odin Project Curriculum
See live version at https://ruimendez.github.io/Etch-a-Sketch/

The aim of this project was to create an Etch-a-Sketch on a 16x16 grid of square divs, and setting up an event listener so that the grid divs change color
when the mouse passes over them.
I also added an interactive color picker, a range slider to set the grid scale and an option that sets the event listener to change each div to a random 
color.
